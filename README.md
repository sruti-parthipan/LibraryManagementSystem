# Library Management System using Merge Sort - Project 

## Description

The Library Management System (LMS) employing Merge Sort is a Java-based application designed to efficiently manage library operations by implementing the divide-and-conquer algorithm. This system enhances book cataloging, user management, and borrowing/returning of books through the application of the Merge Sort algorithm for optimized data organization and retrieval.

## Features

1. **User Authentication:** Secure login system for librarians and users to ensure data privacy.

2. **Book Cataloging:** Comprehensive cataloging of books, utilizing the Merge Sort algorithm for efficient sorting and retrieval.

3. **User Management:** Efficient management of user information, including registration, updating details, and tracking borrowing history.

4. **Borrowing and Returning:** Streamlined processes for users to borrow and return books, with real-time updates to book availability.

5. **Advanced Search and Filtering:** Merge Sort implementation for optimizing the display of cataloged books and enabling advanced search capabilities.
